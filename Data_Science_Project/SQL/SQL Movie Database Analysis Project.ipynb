    "\n",
    "This project showcases various SQL techniques for querying and manipulating a complex movie database. From basic select statements to creating views and modifying data, we've explored a wide range of SQL functionalities. These skills are crucial for data analysts and database administrators working with large datasets in the entertainment industry or similar fields.\n",

    "## Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential extensions of this project could include:\n",
    "- Implementing more complex joins to analyze relationships between actors, directors, and movie success\n",
    "- Creating stored procedures for common query patterns\n",
    "- Developing a simple front-end interface for non-technical users to query the database\n",
    "- Integrating with current TMDB API to keep the database updated\n"
