    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we aim to classify close matches in cricket using a dataset of historical matches. A close match is defined as a match where the winning margin is minimal, either by runs or wickets. We use a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a match will be close based on several features such as the application of the Duckworth-Lewis (DL) method, the month in which the match was played, and the toss decision.\n",

    "First, we load the dataset and perform some initial calculations to understand the distribution of certain features."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this project, we developed a model to classify close cricket matches using features related to the timing of the match, the toss decision, and the application of the DL method. The model achieved a reasonable accuracy, but there is room for improvement. Future work could include exploring more sophisticated models, performing feature engineering, and tuning hyperparameters to enhance predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By identifying the factors that contribute to close matches, teams and analysts can gain better insights into match dynamics and strategize accordingly."
