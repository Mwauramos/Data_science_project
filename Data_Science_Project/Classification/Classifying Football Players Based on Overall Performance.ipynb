    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we classify football players into different performance categories based on their overall ratings. We use the Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers to predict whether a central defender (CB) is \"World Class,\" \"Good,\" or \"Mediocre\" based on various attributes. The dataset contains multiple attributes for each player, allowing us to analyze their performance comprehensively.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to classify football players based on their performance. By identifying key features and optimal parameters for classification models, we can better understand what attributes contribute to a player's success as a central defender. Future work could involve exploring additional features, tuning hyperparameters further, and testing other classification algorithms to improve the model's accuracy and reliability."
